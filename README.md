# parse-and-translate

A program specifically made for my translation project.

Some features (to be implemented):

- Opens a .txt file
- Search for strings with specific parameters

e.g.

```
some kind of string with '^' symbol
"^This is one of the examples of text that I came across while translating"
```

- Gives options to replace the text with the same parameter the text came with
- save both original and replacement text in a .csv file so that you can refer back to it easily
- Save the file (very important haha)


## Stretch:

- Show line by line of each parse
- Allow word-by-word replacement within the line
